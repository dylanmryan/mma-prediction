# MMA Fight Prediction

Predicting UFC fight winners, method of victory, and finish round.
Elo baseline -> XGBoost -> PyTorch multi-task net, honestly evaluated.

Work in progress. Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-10-mma-prediction-design.md`

## Quickstart

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv/bin/python scripts/download_data.py   # Kaggle UFC dataset -> data/raw/
.venv/bin/python scripts/make_dataset.py    # clean parquet -> data/processed/
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_ratings.py   # tune + build Elo ratings
.venv/bin/pytest
```

## Results so far

All models are evaluated on a strict time split: tuned on pre-2020 fights,
reported on 2021–2023 validation fights. **Test years (2024+) are held out
until the final model comparison.**

| Model | Accuracy | Log-loss | Brier |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coin flip | 0.500 | 0.693 | 0.250 |
| Higher-Elo-wins dummy | 0.573 | — | — |
| **Elo baseline** | **0.576** | **0.678** | **0.242** |

The Elo system: fighters start at 1500; K = 64 for a fighter's first 5 UFC
fights then 48 (tuned by grid search on pre-2020 log-loss); KO/sub wins get a
1.4× update bonus; separate striking and grappling Elos update in proportion
to how striking-dominated each fight was.

All-time peak Elo (through 2025-09):

| # | Fighter | Peak Elo |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Jon Jones | 1985 |
| 2 | Islam Makhachev | 1938 |
| 3 | Georges St-Pierre | 1917 |
| 4 | Anderson Silva | 1912 |
| 5 | Kamaru Usman | 1907 |
| 6 | Charles Oliveira | 1877 |
| 7 | Max Holloway | 1872 |
| 8 | Francis Ngannou | 1870 |
| 9 | Khabib Nurmagomedov | 1867 |
| 10 | Tony Ferguson | 1867 |
